> ℹ️ The code you see here reflects the local state of the repository inside this workspace. It is not automatically synced to GitHub. To make the commit visible on your GitHub remote, push it explicitly as described below.

## How to Push the Update to GitHub
1. Verify the remote is configured: `git remote -v`.
2. If the remote is missing, add it with `git remote add origin <your_repo_url>`.
3. Push the current branch (named `work`) to GitHub: `git push origin work`.
4. If you prefer to merge into your main branch, open a pull request on GitHub after pushing or push directly with `git push origin work:main` (only if you intend to fast-forward `main`).

## Additional Notes
- The design document lives at `web-app-design.md` for easy review.
- Remember to pull the latest changes from GitHub before editing further: `git pull --rebase origin work`.
